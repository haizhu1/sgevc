# Emotional Voice Conversion with Semi-Supervised Generative Modeling
Emotional Voice Conversion (EVC) is a task that aims to trans-
form the emotional state of speech from one to another while
preserving linguistic information and speaker identity. How-
ever, many studies are limited by the requirement for parallel
speech data between different emotional patterns, which is not
widely available in real-life applications. Moreover, the pro-
cess of annotating emotional data is highly time-consuming and
labor-intensive. This paper proposes a novel semi-supervised
generative model called SGEVC for emotional voice conver-
sion. Our proposed method utilizes variation autoencoder
(VAE) frameworks to disentangle linguistic, speaker identity,
and emotion spaces. Additionally, we integrate Text-to-Speech
(TTS) into the EVC framework to guide the linguistic content
and design the SGEVC framework in an end-to-end manner.
This paper demonstrates that using as little as 1% supervised
data is sufficient to achieve emotional voice conversion. Our
experimental results show that our proposed model achieves the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.
